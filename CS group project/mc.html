        As we have all been aware, the Central Processing Unit(CPU) is
        responsible for every important task carried out in our computer
        system, such as processing data and instructions. However, it is all
        possible because the CPU's components are merging work into one and
        being processed quickly to achieve a desirable result. In subsequent
        sections, we're going to assess those components.

            Registers are in a computer's memory which is used for temporary
            storage of instructions to be passed on to the processor when
            necessary. As they play a significant role in the processing of
            data, these registers are also referred to as processors. The
            register stores data in the form of a memory address, which is
            stored after you have processed the instruction present on that
            memory address and are therefore storing your next instruction's
            memory address. Each type of register is capable of performing a
            variety of functions.

            The cache is a type of random access memory which, temporarily,

            they may be used again and again. It'll make it easier to find
            instructions because they won't need to be fetched out of the RAM,
